Garmin Uploader
===============

Garmin Uploader (aka gupload), uploads files 
(.tcx, .gpx, and .fit files ) created by Garmin fitness 
devices to the http://connect.garmin.com web site.

:star: Yes, it works with the latest (February 2017) Garmin connect authentication update.

This is an up to date version of [GCPUploader](https://github.com/dlotton/GcpUploader) by Dave Lotton. Thanks Dave for creating this tool :+1:

Garmin Connect Account
-----------------------
You must already have a Garmin Connect account set up.  If you
don't have one, go to https://connect.garmin.com and create your
user account.  The login credentials (username or email and password) for this account are 
required for uploading data to Garmin Connect.


Config File:
-----------
You may create a config file containing your Garmin Connect
username and password to eliminate the need to type it in 
on the command line.  

 :warning: WARNING!!! The username and password
are stored in clear text, WHICH IS NOT SECURE.  If you have 
concerns about storing your garmin connect username and 
password in an unsecure file, do not use this option.

Create a text file named .guploadrc (gupload.ini for Windows
users) containing the following:

```
[Credentials]
username=<username>
password=<password>
```

Replace <username> and <password> with your Garmin Connect
login credentials.  gupload looks for this file either in
your home directory (usually something like '/home/<username>' 
in Linux, or C:\Documents and Settings\<username>' in Windows)
, or in the current working directory (the directory you are 
in when you execute gupload).  See help below for priority 
information.
