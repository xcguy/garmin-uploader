    Status Output:
        The script will log infos about operations on stderr.
        Nothing is written on stdout.

    Credentials:
        Username and password credentials may be placed in a configuration file
        located either in the current working directory, or in the user's home
        directory.  WARNING, THIS IS NOT SECURE. USE THIS OPTION AT YOUR OWN
        RISK.  Username and password are stored as clear text in a file
        format that is consistent with Microsoft (r) INI files.

        The configuration file must contain a [Credentials] section containing
        'username' and 'password' entries.

        The name of the config file for non-windows platforms is '.guploadrc'
        for windows platforms the config file is named 'gupload.ini'.


        Example \'.guploadrc\' (or \'gupload.ini\' for windows):
            [Credentials]
            username=<myusername>
            password=<mypassword>

        Replace <myusername> and <mypassword> above with your own login
        credentials.

    Priority of credentials:
        Command line credentials take priority over config files, current
        directory config file takes priority over a config file in the user's
        home directory.

    CSV List Files:
        A CSV (comma separated values) file can be created to associate files
        with filename and file type information.  Each record (line) in the csv
        file consists of three fields (filename, name, type).  Fields are
        separated by commas, and text containing spaces or special characters
        is quoted with double quotes (\").  Empty fields may be left blank, but
        the field separators must be present.  THE FIRST LINE IN THE CSV FILE
        DEFINES THE ORDER OF THE FIELDS AND *MUST* CONTAIN THE KEY WORDS
        \'filename\', \'name\', and \'type\'.  Most popular spreadsheet
        programs can save files in CSV format, or files can be easily
        constructed in your favorite text editor.

        Example \'file_list.csv\':
            filename, name, type
            file1.tcx, "10K race", running
            file2.fit, "Training Run", running
            file3.fit, , swimming

        Example \'file_list2.csv\' (note field order changed):
            name, filename, type
            "10K race", file1.tcx, running
            "Training Run", file2.fit, running
            , file3.fit, swimming

    Examples:
        Upload file and set activty name:
            gupload -u myusername -p mypassword -a 'Run at park - 12/23' myfile.tcx

        Upload multiple files:
            gupload -u myusername -p mypassword myfile1.tcx myfile2.tcx myfile3.fit

        Upload multiple files and set activity type for all to running:
            gupload -u myusername -p mypassword -t "running" myfile1.tcx myfile2.tcx

        Upload files using config file for credentials and csv list file:
            gupload file_list.csv

        Upload file using config file for credentials, name file, verbose
        output:
            gupload -v 1 -a 'Run at park - 12/23' myfile.tcx
